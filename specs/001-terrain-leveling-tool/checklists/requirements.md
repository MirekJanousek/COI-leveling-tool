# Specification Quality Checklist: COI Terrain Leveling Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on the first review iteration.
- Clarification validation passed after defining straight-line drag placement and atomic rejection when any selected tile is invalid.
- Clarification validation passed after defining Unity construction and fallback costs, parent-tile eligibility, retaining-wall non-overlap, and full refunds on terrain-mutation failure.
- The exact supported stable game version and matching official modding guidance are intentionally pinned during planning, as defined by the specification's compatibility assumption.
